# social-media-apis
## Description

As part of this assignment, I was tasked with creating API endpoints for a social network database using the Mongoose package for Object Relational Mapping and Mongo DB, which is a NoSQL database service.
The "Social Network" I was tasked with creating is comprised of users, thoughts, which can be likened to posts on some popular social media platforms, reactions to thoughts, which can be likened to comments on posts, and friends, which in essence are other users.


## Features

- Endpoints to retrieve all users in the database, retrieve a single user by user id, and create a new user
- Endpoints to update user information by user id, delete a user by id, attribute a friend to a user, and remove a friend from a user's friend array
- Endpoints to retrieve all thoughts in the database, retrieve a single thought by thought id, and create a new thought
- Endpoints to update thought information by thought id, delete a thought by id, attribute a reaction to a thought, and remove a reaction from a thought's reaction array

## Usage

Below you will find a link to a video that demonstrates the functionality of the endpoints detailed in the features section above:
